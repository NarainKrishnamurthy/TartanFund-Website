                The Tartan Student Fund is Carnegie Mellon’s student managed long-equity investment fund with 
                approximately $50k under management. We were generously given this allocation by the CMU 
                endowment and actively work with the university investment office in managing the portfolio.<br/><br/>

                The fund’s key mission and objective is to teach undergraduate students the fundamental skills and 
                concepts of growth and value investing. We run a series of educational workshops at the beginning of each 
                semester to educate members on skills such as basic accounting, stock ratio analysis, and equity 
                valuation methodologies. In addition, we provide our members with the opportunity to gain investing 
                experience with real capital, preceded by company research, due diligence, and pitches to the entire 
                fund.<br/><br/>

                The TSF is structured into four industry verticals: Consumer Retail, Financial Institutions, Healthcare, Power/Industrials, and Tech, Media, Telecom. Each industry group is  run by a portfolio manager and an assistant portfolio manager, and they work alongside a handful of investment analysts to research and pitch companies in their respective industries.
